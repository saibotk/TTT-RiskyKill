## TTT-RiskyKill

Adds a notification for all players, to show that a player has died.
This only appears, if the player was not killed silently, and if there are at least (currently) 7 players.

This was meant to add some difficulty and improved gameplay for large groups, by making stupid killing more risky.

#### ConVars:
ttt_rk_enabled 1 - Enable/Disable Risky Kill
ttt_rk_min_players 7 - Min players for RK to be active
